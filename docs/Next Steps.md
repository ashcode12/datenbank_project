### **âœ… Completed So Far**
âœ” **Database Schema:** All tables are created.  
âœ” **Sample Data:** Data has been inserted into all tables.  
âœ” **Joins & Queries:** Queries have been tested and are working correctly.  
âœ” **Documentation:** Detailed documentation has been created, including explanations and query results.

### **ðŸš€ Next Steps**
Now that the database structure and queries are set up, the next logical step is to **integrate the database with PHP** to make it interactive.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: PHP Integration (Database Connection)**
We will:
1. **Create a PHP script (`db_connect.php`) to connect to MySQL** and verify the connection.
2. **Ensure queries can be run from PHP.**
3. **Test connection before moving to dynamic queries.**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: PHP CRUD Operations**
Once the database connection is working, we will:
1. **Create Users:** A simple PHP form to add users.
2. **View Users:** Fetch and display users from the database.
3. **Update Users:** Modify user details.
4. **Delete Users:** Remove users from the database.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Advanced PHP Functionality**
1. **Display Recipes & Ingredients Dynamically:** Show recipes with ingredients using joins.
2. **Implement a Shopping List Feature:** Allow users to create and manage shopping lists.
3. **User Favorites:** Let users add or remove favorite recipes.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Deployment Preparation**
Once everything works locally, we will:
1. **Export the database (`mysqldump`).**
2. **Set up the project on your Ubuntu server.**
3. **Test the live environment.**
4. **Finalize the documentation with deployment steps.**
